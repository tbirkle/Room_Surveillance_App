As of now, there are Cameras available to buy, which can do everything our area surveillance app can do. But they cost much more and the source code isn’t available. So you can’t add new features easily. For example the camera we used, the Lupus LE950 can detect faces and you can configure it so it will only observe a selected area in the picture. There are also system which can handle more cameras at once to observe more than one area.
