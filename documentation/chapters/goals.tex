\section[Goals and requirements]{Goals and requirements}
We wanted to create something similar to the Lupus LE950. A system which can take images if you walk through a sensor and which can upload the image to the internet/mobile phone. A simple surveillance system. The Lupus LE950 is very expensive and we wanted to create a system which costs less money than the Lupus and where we can tinker a little bit. The requirement was, that we have to use the arduino uno for the task. The arduino is limited in its processing power so we couldnâ€™t implement features such face detection. We wanted to test the arduino, how fast can it process the image and how big can the images be.
