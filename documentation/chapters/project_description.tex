\section{Project description}
The \emph{room surveillance app} observes rooms in your building. Whenever the system is active, it will take a picture if a movement is detected. Afterwards the picture will be sent to your smart phone.


\subsection{System architecture}
The movements will be detected with a passive infra-red-sensor (PIR). The PIR is connected to an arduino board. The arduino and the camera are connected to a LAN. If the PIR is triggered, the arduino gets an image from the camera over the common gateway interface(CGI). The image will be uploaded to a webserver. The smart phone app polls in a specific interval, whether a new picture is available on the webserver and downloads it.
