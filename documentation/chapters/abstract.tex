\section*{Abstract}
The area surveillance system observes areas in your building. Whenever the system is active, it will take a picture if a movement is detected. The movements will be detected with a passive infra-red-sensor (PIR). The PIR is connected to an arduino board. The arduino and the camera are connected to a LAN. If the PIR is triggered, the arduino gets an image from the camera over the common gateway interface(CGI). The image will be uploaded to a webserver. The mobile phone app receives a notification message via the google cloud messaging server(GCM). Afterwards the user can download the image to his mobile phone.
